# Favicon Icons Setup

This directory should contain favicon icons. For production, please add:

- `icon-192.png` (192x192 pixels)
- `icon-512.png` (512x512 pixels)

You can generate these icons using:
1. Online tools like https://favicon.io/
2. Design tools like Figma or Photoshop
3. AI image generators

Recommended design:
- Use the "DD" logo or a horror-themed icon
- Background: Dark green (#22c55e) or dark background
- Style: Match the horror theme of the site

The `app/icon.tsx` file will generate a dynamic favicon as a fallback, but static PNG files are recommended for better performance.
